# Home-Automation-system-android-application

Home automation system android application
- The main aim of this project is to control the Electric Equipment present in our Homes or Offices using a smartphone.
- Equipment like lights, fans, ACs, etc. can be controlled by this application.
- You can access your Equipment from anywhere in the Range of the Wi-Fi module or when your mobile is connected to the Internet.
- The domain of the project is IoT and Mobile Application.

# Connection of android application and IoT device
- The android application connects to the IoT device via wifi.
- When you perform some operation on the application it sends data to IoT device in the encoded protocol that I have developed to minimize data corruption and error with minimal overhead.
- Redundant bits are added for error detection at the end of the string.
